# 📌 Overview

This folder contains my full work for the Predicting Road Accident Risk Kaggle competition.
The task was to build a model that predicts the relative risk of road accidents based on historical and environmental features.

This was one of my early “serious” competitions — a good warm-up for feature engineering and proper validation.

Rank: 1327/4082 → Top ~32%

Private Score: 0.05585

Takeaway: Model generalized reasonably well; validation did not collapse on private LB.


# 💡 Learnings & Notes
- Ensemble models shine for tabular problems.
- Cross-validation is your best friend.
- Don’t trust good public LB jumps without checking CV first.
- Try feature selection next time — some noise features hurt the model.
