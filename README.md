# Kaggle Kombat
Your girl enters the data dojo.
This repo is where all my Kaggle battles, ML experiments, and competition pipelines live — the good, the bad, and the “why did this model overfit after 3 epochs.”

# What This Repo Is
A centralized place for all my Kaggle competition work:
- Clean, reusable notebooks
- Modular ML pipelines
- Proper validation setups
- My submissions, experiments, and battle scars
- Occasional chaos

The goal:
Become that person who casually says, “Oh yeah, I got a medal.”
